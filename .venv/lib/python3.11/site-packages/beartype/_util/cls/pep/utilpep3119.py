    Raise an exception of the passed type unless the passed object is an
    **isinstanceable class** (i.e., class whose metaclass does *not* define an
    ``__instancecheck__()`` dunder method that raises an exception).

    Classes that are *not* isinstanceable include most PEP-compliant type
    hints, notably:

    * **Generic aliases** (i.e., subscriptable classes overriding the
      ``__class_getitem__()`` class dunder method standardized by :pep:`560`
      subscripted by an arbitrary object) under Python >= 3.9, whose
      metaclasses define an ``__instancecheck__()`` dunder method to
      unconditionally raise an exception. Generic aliases include:

      * :pep:`484`-compliant **subscripted generics.**
      * :pep:`585`-compliant type hints.

    * User-defined classes whose metaclasses define an ``__instancecheck__()``
      dunder method to unconditionally raise an exception, including:

      * :pep:`544`-compliant protocols *not* decorated by the
        :func:`typing.runtime_checkable` decorator.

    Motivation
    ----------
    When a class whose metaclass defines an ``__instancecheck__()`` dunder
    method is passed as the second parameter to the :func:`isinstance` builtin,
    that builtin defers to that method rather than testing whether the first
    parameter passed to that builtin is an instance of that class. If that
    method raises an exception, that builtin raises the same exception,
    preventing callers from deciding whether arbitrary objects are instances
    of that class. For brevity, we refer to that class as "non-isinstanceable."

    Most classes are isinstanceable, because deciding whether arbitrary objects
    are instances of those classes is a core prerequisite for object-oriented
    programming. Most classes that are also PEP-compliant type hints, however,
    are *not* isinstanceable, because they're *never* intended to be
    instantiated into objects (and typically prohibit instantiation in various
    ways); they're only intended to be referenced as type hints annotating
    callables, an arguably crude form of callable markup.

    :mod:`beartype`-decorated callables typically check the types of arbitrary
    objects at runtime by passing those objects and types as the first and
    second parameters to the :func:`isinstance` builtin. If those types are
    non-isinstanceable, those type-checks will typically raise
    non-human-readable exceptions (e.g., ``"TypeError: isinstance() argument 2
    cannot be a parameterized generic"`` for :pep:`585`-compliant type hints).
    This is non-ideal both because those exceptions are non-human-readable
    *and* because those exceptions are raised at call rather than decoration
    time, where users expect the :mod:`beartype.beartype` decorator to raise
    exceptions for erroneous type hints.

    Thus the existence of this function, which the :mod:`beartype.beartype`
    decorator calls to validate the usability of type hints that are classes
    *before* checking objects against those classes at call time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : object
        Object to be validated.
    exception_cls : TypeException, optional
        Type of exception to be raised. Defaults to
        :exc:`BeartypeDecorHintPep3119Exception`.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable label prefixing the representation of this object in the
        exception message. Defaults to the empty string.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintPep3119Exception
        If this object is *not* an isinstanceable class.

    ``True`` only if the passed object is either an **isinstanceable class**
    (i.e., class whose metaclass does *not* define an ``__instancecheck__()``
    dunder method that raises an exception) *or* tuple containing only
    isinstanceable classes.

    This tester is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator). Although the implementation does *not*
    trivially reduce to an efficient one-liner, the inefficient branch of this
    implementation *only* applies to erroneous edge cases resulting in raised
    exceptions and is thus largely ignorable.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This tester may return false positives in unlikely edge cases.**
    Internally, this tester tests whether this class is isinstanceable by
    detecting whether passing the ``None`` singleton and this class to the
    :func:`isinstance` builtin raises an exception. If that call raises *no*
    exception, this class is probably but *not* necessarily isinstanceable.
    Since the metaclass of this class could define an ``__instancecheck__()``
    dunder method to conditionally raise exceptions *except* when passed the
    ``None`` singleton, there exists *no* perfect means of deciding whether an
    arbitrary class is fully isinstanceable in the general sense. Since most
    classes that are *not* isinstanceable are unconditionally isinstanceable
    (i.e., the metaclasses of those classes define an ``__instancecheck__()``
    dunder method to unconditionally raise exceptions), this distinction is
    generally meaningless in the real world. This test thus generally suffices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : object
        Object to be tested.

    Returns
    ----------
    bool
        ``True`` only if this object is either:

        * An isinstanceable class.
        * A tuple containing only isinstanceable classes.

def is_type_or_types_issubclassable(cls: object) -> bool:
    '''
    ``True`` only if the passed object is either an **issubclassable class**
    (i.e., class whose metaclass does *not* define a ``__subclasscheck__()``
    dunder method that raises an exception) *or* tuple containing only
    issubclassable classes.

    This tester is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator). Although the implementation does *not*
    trivially reduce to an efficient one-liner, the inefficient branch of this
    implementation *only* applies to erroneous edge cases resulting in raised
    exceptions and is thus largely ignorable.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This tester may return false positives in unlikely edge cases.**
    Internally, this tester tests whether this class is issubclassable by
    detecting whether passing the :class:`type` superclass and this class to
    the :func:`issubclass` builtin raises an exception. If that call raises
    *no* exception, this class is probably but *not* necessarily
    issubclassable. Since the metaclass of this class could define a
    ``__subclasscheck__()`` dunder method to conditionally raise exceptions
    *except* when passed the :class:`type` superclass, there exists *no* perfect
    means of deciding whether an arbitrary class is fully issubclassable in the
    general sense. Since most classes that are *not* issubclassable are
    unconditionally issubclassable (i.e., the metaclasses of those classes
    define an ``__subclasscheck__()`` dunder method to unconditionally raise
    exceptions), this distinction is generally meaningless in the real world.
    This test thus generally suffices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : object
        Object to be tested.

    Returns
    ----------
    bool
        ``True`` only if this object is either:

        * An issubclassable class.
        * A tuple containing only issubclassable classes.
